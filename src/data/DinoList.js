Be careful if you chase them, as they will often turn around and attack again without warning. A good strategy is to bring a tough underwater mount, such as a Plesiosaur, and set it to passive. That way, once it has been shot, the Angler will target your mount instead of you, giving time to take it down in relative safety.'}, {General: 'One must first take into consideration the environment that the Angler lives in, the deep ocean. Other animals patrol these waters, making Angler combat or taming difficult. Ichthyosaurs, though friendly, tend to swarm the player and can easily become overwhelming if one attracts the attention of too many of them. Additionally, predators like Megalodon, Mosasaurs, and Plesiosaurs can attack at any time: even the Anglers themselves are dangerous. Finally, asphyxiation and temperature hazards will finish off any survivors rather quickly that have not equipped themselves with a full set of SCUBA Gear.'}, {Strategy: 'Often, the angler will be the one attacking you. In that case, use your mount if it has enough health and attack damage, but also make sure your mount has a quick turning circle to compete with the angler\'s agility. Fighting the Angler without a mount is also possible; use ranged melee weapons that can keep Anglers at bay, like Pikes (Spears are not recommended due to break chance) and when it runs away, use a Crossbow or a Harpoon Launcher to finish it off.'}]

As scavengers, they are also attracted by dead bodies from a surprising distance away.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Raw Mutton'}, {Taming: 'Argentavis has a 3x headshot modifier. Since torpor scales with damage dealt, you can significantly reduce the amount of munitions required to knock one unconscious by ignoring all other parts of the body and opting instead to only go for headshots. Just be mindful of how bloody it is, or you could accidentally kill it with the extra damage. The Argentavis isn\'t as fast as the Pteranodon but will still flee when Torpor is getting high and not resume attacking the Player so it is adviced to prepare for a chase. It\'s relatively easy to keep them in range of a Crossbow or Longneck Rifle but On the other hand, the Argentavis will attack you if you let it get close enough: additionally, their natural spawning ranges (primarily mountains) are usually overrun with dangerous predators, so be aware of your surroundings and be prepared in case the hunt goes sour. The best strategy is simple and effective: first, get your target Argentavis to fly at the ground level by attacking it with either a Crossbow and Tranquilizer Arrows or a Longneck Rifle and Tranquilizer Darts. When it comes in for the attack, simply shoot it in the head* (see below) and then sidestep to avoid its huge talons. The bird will circle back around and repeat the process. When its torpor grows too high, the Argentavis will turn and try to fly away; be quick to shoot it down before it gets out of range.'}, {General: 'The Argentavis can be somewhat of a challenge to hit with any ranged weapons until the first shot has landed. Once it becomes aggressive, it will charge until severely injured or its torpor becomes too high.'}, {Strategy: 'The methods of killing an Argentavis depends on whether you\'re looking to engage it from the ground or from the air. Ranged weapons like the Longneck Rifle, Assault Rifle, and even the Sniper Rifle are suggested if you plan on attacking it from the ground. Once attacked, the Argentavis will become aggressive and fly straight towards the player, head first. This behavior, compounded with their head-shot modifier, makes them fairly easy to kill or knock out assuming you can get a clear shot. If you are attacking the Argentavis from the air, perhaps using a tamed Argentavis of your own, be careful of drawing too large of a crowd. Argentavis tends to spawn in large groups, and attacking one will make all of them aggressive. Watch your back and don\'t let them trap you in a swarm.'}]

To tame one, the player must drop a fertilized Rock Drake egg on the ground and/or near the Basilisk while it is not burrowed (while it will still eat egg even when aggro\'d, chances of it eating are very low even when brought close in its path, and it is best to kite it close and make it lose interest in the player). The Basilisk will "attack" the egg when it is nearby one of them and eat it, gaining taming progress. The ancestry (e.g. the levels of the parents) of each fertilized egg will not affect the taming speed. If more eggs are required, retreat to a safe location for a long duration, as the rate at which the Basilisk returns to being feedable is very low. As flying mounts are not available in the map it exists in, one of such strategy is to utilize Raptor with High movement speed and lure it over to the fertilized egg as it moves relatively quick once aggravated. If dropping while running, ensure the egg are dropped from your own inventory, for when you drop the egg from the mount\'s inventory, the Basilisk will still eat the egg when it is not aggravated, but no taming progress will be made. Another method would be to utilize mounts the Basilisk are not aggravated by, such as Rock Drake. Dismount nearby and mount after getting its attention, then kite it into a circle. Do not hit it. Pay close attention to it-the moment it turns its head away from the drake, dismount to the other side and remount to hold aggro. One can also use a Karkinos. Hold a passive wild dino, such as a parasaur, and aggro the Basilisk. Keep turning in a circle to keep the parasaur safe, and drop the eggs. Using structure involves using dinosaur gates and/or walls with fence foundation while leaving a corner gap small enough for the player to escape, but Basilisk not to escape. However, it will try to attack the structure just to get towards the character, so moving around to get its attention of your location and losing it after is required for this strategy to work. Be mindful for its poison spit though. By far the easiest way to tame a Basilisk is creating a taming pen with pillars and foundations. The basilisk can\'t burrow through foundations so you will never lose taming effectiveness. The Basilisk loses about 7-8% taming effectiveness every time it burrows. (Needs further testing)'}, {General: 'Basilisk always stays hidden throughout its existence through burrowing.

This method works very well for high level dinos (100+), for lower levels a slingshot might work as well. After enough torpor is applied, the Dimorphodon will begin to flee. Now is the time to position oneself directly in the wake of his flightpath (behind him) and shoot him from there to bring it finally down.

If you attract its attention, it will try to push you away, which deals no direct damage (indirectly: fall damage or being pushed into hostile creatures). There is no need to take any exact caution with the Diplodocus in terms of passive taming.

By standing near its front legs at the base of its neck or under its belly, you can actually stay out of the range of its nudging. However, it is perfectly fine to have some fun and play with the Diplodocus by letting it bounce you around, as it will not affect taming effectiveness so long as you don\'t hit it, and make sure as you "play" to get close enough at times to make sure you can feed the Diplodocus again. It is most likely the easiest of all passive tames, and in this unique "playing with a dinosaur to tame it and bond with it" aspect, the most fun tame.

Be aware that the Direbear has very high torpor compared to their health. Monitoring the number of Tranquilizer Arrows you use is very important in order to prevent accidentally killing the Direbear. For instance, levels higher than 16 appear to be nearly impossible to tranquilize with arrows (a Mastercraft Crossbow or above will work). Tranquilizer Darts are advised. It is advised to use Tripwire Narcotic Traps to bring the Direbear down as their unusually high torpor will typically result in death before KO at levels above 25+ when using crossbow and arrows - this is particularly relevant to primitive servers. For instance, a combination of 10 tripwire traps (5 explosions total) combined with tranq. arrows will bring down a level 90-100 bear before it dies - arrows alone will result in death.'}, {General: 'The Direbear is a strong, giant creature that is territorial.

Doedicurus take a very long amount of time to tame with mejo or normal berries, so try to invest in kibble if possible.Due to their high torpor stat, Doedicurus are hard to knock out and can withstand a large number of Tranquilizer Arrows. They take 90% reduced torpor and damage when they are curled up in their protective shell and not moving. Using a Longneck Rifle and Tranquilizer Darts will knock it down with little risk of the Doedicurus curling up, making for an easy tame. A viable knockout strategy involves backpedalling away from the Doed while continuing to unleash your tranq method. Primitive Strategy: If you do not have access to a Longneck Rifle and can only use a bow or cross bow, simply back peddle as you fire arrows at the Doedicurus\' head. Once it curls up stop firing and wait for it to uncurl, the torpor will go down slightly but not enough to make it impossible to knock out. Just wait for the uncurl and repeat. Frog Strategy: Using a high level Beelzebufo has some advantages if the creature is alone. One, you can save your valuable arrows and darts for more difficult targets. Two, you can lick it before it hits you and simply jump over its horizontal tail swing like jump-rope, even landing behind it, just make sure you don\'t land within range of another attack. Using the basically infinite torpor inducing attacks of the frog, you can afford to keep hitting it after it curls up when your tranqs would be mostly wasted. When you see a lot of blood on the Doed, you should start only using the primary attack as it does less damage so you won\'t kill it.

    info: [{Behaviour: 'General: The entity that is the Giant Bee consist of the Queen Bee and the drone (called Giant Bee in game). Queen: The Queen Bee is the center of the Giant Bee entity. She is the larger of the two that players will encounter. When she spawns into the world, she automatically becomes a hive. Note that the Queen may despawn shortly after spawning in and turning into a hive, even when she is spawned in by a player. Wild Queens will spawn drones to protect her while she flees from the recently destroyed hive, and will keep spawning them after tamed. Once tamed, she can be interacted with like other pets but she does not gain XP and cannot level up past the post tame additional levels. (+2 max on private game) She tends to spawn at level 5. She has an inventory that can have items placed in it, and a food bar but it does not drain very fast. From tests, she can eat both raw meat and Rare Flowers, but seems to require hand feeding. The Queen will continuously spawn drone that seem to not count towards the player\'s tame count, as they do not show up as red in the kill feed if killed by the owning player or fellow tribe members. Drones: Drones are smaller of the two Giant Bees. They will spawn from inside a wild hive and will swarm any attackers. Once the Queen is tamed, they can be interacted with the exception of having an inventory or a progression system. They can and will protect the player if their aggression is not set to Passive. They can also follow the player, but only a certain distance before returning to the Queen. Giant Bee drones can be uploaded to a beacon or Obelisks, and can be redownloaded. If they are downloaded, they will be severed from the Queen and can be used as guard dogs. However, like a Forcetamed Titanoboa, they cannot be fed or leveled up, and will despawn when the player reloads the same world. Drones cannot be acquired from a tamed hive, and are only produced by a tamed Queen. She will only produce a certain amount, and the Drones seem to have life spans. Sometimes they will live for 30 minutes or so and sometimes they will die en masse within a few seconds of spawning.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Rare Flowers'}, {Taming: 'The Giant Bee is a passive tame. You have to crack open the hive to get to the queen, then feed it Ichthyornis Kibble or Rare Flowers. She will also eat raw and cooked mutton. Some hives are empty though. If the hive is occupied, a swarm of Giant Bees will come out and attack the person who damaged it. You can check without damaging the hive however, by staying near it and listening for the sounds the queen makes, as she can be heard beating her wings and occasionally buzzing from inside. Only occupied hives have a Queen - empty ones just have some honey to harvest every 15 minutes (press E, Xbox: Y, PS4: Triangle on the hive). Use a dino or shoot the nest until it breaks. You can also build a pillar under the hive and place a C4 Charge on top of the pillar to take the hive out in a single blast without having to worry about getting stung. The Queen will slowly descend towards the ground where you can begin taming. You can use a Quetzal or another flying mount, but be warned, if it gets stung you will get dismounted. A quetzal with a platform saddle is the best option due to its high AOE (area of effect), and you won\'t be thrown far if you\'re dismounted. Try not to accidentally kill the queen. Sometimes the queen gets stuck in the tree and will not move from where her hive was destroyed. One very effective method to gain access to a queen is to use Dimorphodons; as they are extremely efficient for breaking open bee hives and aiding in the taming of the queen, arguably more so than using firearms or explosives. Being flyers, a small swarm of Dimorphodons can easily reach and quickly break open any hive when whistled to attack it, without angering the drones, provided the player keeps a far enough distance away while they do this. Once the hive is broken and the queen is exposed, they can be whistled to passive and brought back, without harming the queen or drawing the attention of drones so long as they are called back quickly enough. Once returned to the player\'s position, they can be set to neutral to guard any mounts or other tamed dinos while the player is occupied with the long-chase process of taming the queen bee. A suggested mount to use while searching for bee hives, that pairs nicely with the Dimorphodons, is a Tapejara. With their maneuverability in flight, they make controlling the camera and spotting wild hives that much easier. Once the hive is broken and the queen exposed, use a Ghillie Suit to prevent stings, as well as Bug Repellant to get close enough. Feeding your dino Bug Repellant does work in combination with your repellant. This allows you to get close enough without angering the drones. However, if you get too close or touch the queen, the drones will become angry and attack regardless. On Scorched Earth, they are found exclusively on the walls of the canyon that runs through the middle of the High Desert, near Canyon Cave. Sometimes it is possible to get more than one Queen from the wild hive.'}, {General: 'Stings will dismount riders and slow players, making them easy targets for the swarm. Their small size makes them difficult to hit at times, and move at a fair pace allowing them to chase any assailant attempting to raid the hive. The drones are fairly slow and have low health, making them easy targets for ranged weapons.'}, {Strategy: 'Performing a barrel roll with a Pteranodon is a relatively safe way to destroy the hive without wasting too many resources such as bullets. If the barrel roll is aimed correctly, the Pteranodon damages the hive with more damage than its regular attack, and the barrel roll also allows the rider to move past the hive fast enough in order to not get stung by the Drones. Rocket launcher is also great against wild hive.'}]

Their lack of natural predator, or really any form of threat to them, allows for their safe voyages across the Island. Beware. The Giganotosaurus is an aggressive creature. Due to its rage mechanic, it will get angrier when being attacked, which makes its attacks deal more damage. Also, it regains stamina faster when enraged. If it builds up too much rage, it may even kick off its own rider and attack them.  Its rage mechanic is not a health-percentage based trigger, it only occurs if enough damage occurs quickly enough. It will also trigger even if the server is set to the friendliest possible PvE and no friendly-fire settings, in which normally it is not possible to hurt anything not wild. Due to its large stride, allowing it to walk over most obstacles, and naturally high movement speed, the Giganotosaurus can outrun just about anything on the island. Combined with its very large aggro range this means it is a fast and dangerous predator.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Raw Mutton'}, {Taming: 'Tranq arrows are absolutely the best option for knocking a Giga down. Due to the huge health pool (80k base health) of wild Gigas, you have no reason to worry about accidentally killing it. Also, crossbows being able to fire at roughly double the rate of the longneck rifle proves invaluable when trying to knock out a creature who is capable of shaking off 10k torpor in a matter of seconds. Factor in the cost difference between making tranq darts/shock darts compared to tranq arrows and there is just no contest. Leave the rifle at home and bring a high quality crossbow (or a few). By far the simplest way to tame Giganotosaurus is to build a room out of Metal Dinosaur Gateway (no gates needed), leaving one side open, and put a Large Bear Trap in the middle. Do not use the snap points, as this will make the room too small to place the fourth wall, and allow the Giganotosaurus to escape. Instead, leave a foot or two gap in between each gateway. You then lure the Giganotosaurus in so that it\'ll get stuck in the bear trap, then fill in the remaining wall with another Metal Dinosaur Gateway. The Giga will be unable to escape the enclosure and you can shoot at it until it\'s down. Settle in, it may take a while. Another strategy (which is much harder) is to use a Quetzal with a platform saddle and a shooting platform built on it and to simply follow the Giga around and shoot it with tranq arrows until it falls down. This method is very time consuming and difficult due to the tendency of wild dinos to pick a direction and sprint flat out away from you when they realize they are being tranquilized. Couple this with the surprising speed of a wild Giga and you\'re in for a long chase. The addition of Griffins gives you another option—no need to dismount, but remember they don\'t have as much stamina. Don\'t over-focus and wind up coming to a forced landing right in front of your Giga. Once knocked out, it\'s rather simple to keep the beast down for the duration of the tame. Simply let its torpor get low (not too low) and then spam a few hundred narcotics into it. It is highly recommended to learn how narcotic works before taming a Giga. Due to the incredibly high amount of torpor Gigas have though, you will usually be able to feed it enough or almost enough narcotic to last the entire tame in one shot. This allows for the player(s) to simply set a timer to come back when it\'s ready to feed or when it will need more narcotic since no land animal or dinosaur will attack a wild Giga.'}, {General: 'A Giganotosaurus in the Wild, or tamed, is extremely dangerous, simply because of its massive damage and health. This makes it one of the most deadly creatures on the island (if not the most deadly); even a low level wild Giganotosaurus can be a very serious threat. Avoid it if you don\t want to get devoured in one or two bites.'}, {Strategy: ' wild Giga is best avoided at all costs. If it absolutely must be dealt with, it\'s best to lure them into either water or lava and then fly straight up to lose aggro and let it burn/drown to death. Outright killing a wild Giga will take a LOT of firepower. DO NOT attack a wild Giga with any tamed dinosaurs. Even a very high level tamed Giga will lose 99% of the time against a very low level wild Giga (due to the fact that tamed Gigas have significantly less health and power when tamed, and barely increase per level up). The only dinos that would ever have a chance would be Wyverns, which in comparison is very squishy and will be killed very, very quickly if you make a single mistake. Lightning Wyverns are the best choice if you wish to rid of a Giga through dino power since their lightning breath can hit them from a safe distance in the air. Simply hover over them and keep using the breath attack, but be mindful of stamina! If you are low on stamina just fly to a distant area and land, then repeat. As a forewarning, the Wyvern and Giga hitboxes can get stuck on each other and put you in extreme danger. Just be very careful. Griffins may make it possible to kill a Giga, as a rider can use weapons while flying. Make certain to have multiple spare assault rifles, fabricated sniper rifles, and rocket launchers; with the Giga\'s massive health pool, some may break during your hunt. You will also need a huge stockpile of ammo. You will probably need to level the Griffin for weight, unless the Giga is far enough away from anything important that you have enough time to run back to base and rearm. Remember that although you control steering with the A and D keys while using weapons on a Griffin, your pitch still follows where you\'re looking; if you\'re looking sideways and down at the Giga and suddenly decide to sprint forward, you won\'t go straight to the Giga, but you will go down where it can get you if it\'s faster than you are. Stay high. Remember to stop, gain some distance and replenish your Griffin\'s stamina periodically; a forced landing right in front of the Giga is not ideal. The Phoenix has a fireball attack (right click) that can allow you to attack a Giga from overhead without it getting angry in response, unless you get too close. The DoT deals up to 100 damage per second for 10 seconds. This means it would take at least 80 fireballs and 800 seconds to kill it. While it\'s a slow process, it\'s fairly reliable and safe since the Phoenix does not have to land to regain stamina. Keep in mind that the Phoenix will not get kill credit unless a different source of damage from the Phoenix kills it. Another possibility is to build a raft with a massive broadside of Minigun Turrets, fully stocked with ammo, and a generator; lure the Giga into the water and let the turrets shred it. If the turrets fail to kill the Giga before running out of ammunition you should at least be able to get clear, as Gigas are slow swimmers; try to lure it further into the water and hope that either it drowns, or aquatic predators can finish it off. If fighting against tamed Gigas in PvP, they are not near as much of a threat. While still a terrifying foe, Gigas lose 63k health and 80% melee when tamed, dropping them to a much more manageable 17k base health and making low level Gigas do less damage than a high melee rex. This means that a group of solid rexes can take on an enemy tamed Giga (bonus if the rexes are Mate boosted). Auto turrets can also shred a tamed Giga fairly quickly if you have enough of them. If attacking tamed Gigas, using 2-3 rpgs to enrage it and cause it to attack any other enemy dinos near it is a good strategy. If you do not have access to explosives, dinos that reflect damage such as the Kentrosaurus are very effective at fending off a ridden giga; due to changes in the rage mechanics, raw damage is factored as opposed to mitigated damage. This can cause a Giga to enrage by biting a herd of Kentros, no matter how good of a saddle it has. Even if the Giga is unridden, the sheer amount of reflected damage from Kentros can kill an attacking tamed Giga. The only dino that can kill a wild Giganotosaurus head-on is the Titanosaur. Wild Gigas avoid attacking them, with good reason. A few stomp attacks made by a Titan is enough to kill the strongest Giga. However, the odds of anyone just so happening to have a Titanosaur on hand to spare for this battle of behemoths are slim, so it is generally best to avoid the dangerous predator at all costs.'}]

Surprisingly despite its size, Karkinos can also be found in the rivers of artifact caves.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Spoiled Meat'}, {Taming: 'Much like a Rock Elemental, Karkinos cannot be knocked out with the traditional arrows, darts or animal torpor attacks; instead requiring weapons like the Catapult Turret or Cannon aimed at the main body. Hitting the limbs instead of the crab\'s body will deal heavy damage to the creature instead of applying torpor, so aim carefully. A few misplaced shots, especially with the cannon, can easily kill the Karkinos, or render health so low that the taming attempt will have to be abandoned until it recovers. Due to the difficult aiming mechanics of the cannon, and the cost of ammunition, it is recommended to use a catapult turret instead, being both more cost effective and far easier to aim. One catapult shot deals roughly 400 torpor, and with a high rate of fire, the turret can easily outpace the cannon in terms of how quickly torpor is applied. Paracer Strategy: Perhaps the best method of bringing down a Karkinos is placing a Catapult Turret on a platform saddle; the only candidate in Aberration, which just so happens to have the perfect height for this role, is the Paracer. If positioned just behind the rider\'s seat, the catapult is able to shoot almost directly down behind the Paracer\'s rear, which is typically where a Karkinos will be if the Paracer is made to face away from it. While attempting this strategy, be sure your Paracer is set to passive, and that the Karkinos is first targeting the Paracer instead of you before dismounting to climb onto the catapult. With careful aiming, a Karkinos can be easily, and safely knocked out from atop your Paracer\'s back. One of the few drawbacks to this strategy is that Karkinos will often attempt to flee once their torpor reaches a certain point, but a catapult\'s quick firing rate gives you a decent window to land the knockout before it has the chance to run. Trap Strategy: Karkinos tend to move around quite a lot, sometimes making them difficult targets to get a lock on. Building a stone trap out of dinosaur gates or pillars to keep them still is a viable option, although costly in terms of time and resources needed to build one. Trapping a Karkinos can also prove difficult, as they are capable of jumping over and out once contained, and trying to shut the trap can easily result in a survivor being grabbed by the crab, causing a swift death. There is the added disadvantage that said traps are stationary, and cannot be moved, sometimes causing you to lure the desired Karkinos over long distances before it can be trapped. If you choose to build a trap, build a three to four wall high tower near to it on which to place the catapult for aiming down. Be aware however that once a Karkinos is closed in, it can behave erratically; turning in all directions as it attacks the enclosure, sometimes making it difficult to land a good shot. A good time to take the shot is when the crab is facing away or towards you, as less limbs get in the way of your strike.'}, {General: 'The Karkinos attempts to grapple you and repeatedly slam you into the ground.'}, {Strategy: 'Stay away from the front of the creature, as it can pick you up and immobilize you as it turns you into a tasty snack. Underneath its belly or directly behind it are the best positions to maintain. Try to attack the legs. Spinos are generally the best dino to attack it with, since it cannot lift you off of a Spinosaurus. If you do not have a large enough dinosaur to combat the Karkinos directly, it\'s better to utilize a crossbow or a compound bow with metal arrows from a ledge that it can not reach over. Don\'t waste your ammo with guns such as the Longneck Rifle or Shotgun; the Karkinos takes significantly reduced damage from guns, but takes normal damage from arrows.

However, the main problem you are going to face is that unlike the Ichthy and Mesopithecus, the manta is a hostile creature which makes this tame very frustrating and, due to the Manta\'s high damage output, even dangerous.

You can touch his stingers and his rear end of the "wings" without him attacking you but not his forward parts, upper side or underside (go very shallow). If they start to wander off to deeper waters, go in with your mount again and bait them back to the shallow. If you have a rather large mount, go to shallow waters near the coast and find a spot of water that is shallow enough for your mount to stand in, but is too deep for your character to stand in, causing him to swim.

If the manta is close to your mount, dismount, jump near it and try to feed it again, after which you will go on your mount again. Repeat this step until the creature is yours.

While the other player does this, shoot it with Tranquilizer Arrows. Repeat until it is knocked unconscious. The rocks that are just under the water in the sea are a good taming spot for this. Stand on a shallow spot and the sharks will stick their heads out to attack you, allowing you to easily shoot them with a bow. You can also tame one or several ichthyosaurus (which requires only meat) and swim them up into a river too shallow for the megalodon. The megalodons will group at the head of the river, usually partway out of the water. A crossbow is useful in taming the Megalodon as it can be fired underwater, unlike the bow. As you can fire a crossbow from the back of an ichthyosaurus, a bit of fancy riding can let you run circles around the Megalodon while shooting it. This also allows you to \'herd\' it to where you want it to be knocked out, as it will start swimming away from you as its torpor nears max. Using the Scorpion is another good tactic to knock out the Megalodon, since the scorpion can swim. Ride it and sting the shark, then back up out of range. Repeat this every ten seconds until the shark falls asleep.'}, {General: 'It is not recommended to full on engage a Megalodon in the water, but rather attack it from an advantageous position such as a raft, rock, the shore, or perhaps even a platform above or partially in the water.'}, {Strategy: 'Make sure you see it coming! Escape if you cannot fight, or instigate the battle if ready. If you plan to engage a Megalodon via the shoreline, make sure you have either a Sword, Pike, or an adequate supply of Spears. Megalodons appear to lose interest in the player when the player is swimming in shallow water around the beaches. Thus, a very easy way to deal with even large groups of Megalodons is to lure them into the water around the beaches and repeatedly stab them until they die, as they will not attack the player. Just make sure that you keep an eye on your Stamina!'}]

The rate of torpor decay makes it unlikely that any narcotics will be required for this tame. Starve taming is highly recommended for taming the megalosaurus i.e. allowing the creature\'s hunger to deplete until it is below the target value, and then inserting all the food at once. You need to keep at least one piece of food in its inventory for when it wakes up. Using the longneck rifle and tranquilliser darts is almost mandatory. Any other method will almost certainly kill the creature. Even then, it\'s exceptionally risky. An alternative is to use Narcotic Tripwires. After first knocking out the megalosaurus, you can use its maximum torpor to calculate how many trip wires are required to almost knock-it-out the next evening (and even set-up the tripwires while it is asleep). Be sure not to completely knock it out with tripwires, though, as a creature knocked out by the tripwire itself will not starve and is inaccessible. You can also use Enduro Stew to regenerate Megalosaurus health during starve taming. Use creatures that permit mounted weaponry, such as a sabertooth or carno, to tank the megalosaurus while you tranquillise it from the mount\'s back. The sabertooth will be subject to the megalosaurus\' pick-up attack and, depending on the angle, you may need to dismount to begin shooting. While it has your tame in its mouth, it will not pay any attention to you, but will not let it go until it dies or is knocked out. A waking (i.e. not curled-up) megalosaurus can be picked up by a quetzal. It is possible to lure a megalosaurus out of the cave, and relatively easy (safe) to do so during the day, and from there you can carry the megalosaurus to a taming enclosure or other suitable location.'}, {General: 'Megalosaurus can be found inside some of the caves on The Island, The Center, and Scorched Earth. In Ragnarok it can be found above ground in Viking Bay and on slosher slope. On the Aberration map they are found in the lower levels and do not have a sleep/wake cycle. When taming, it is recommended to clear out any other animals inside the cave. Currently only four wild Megalosaurus are on an individual map/server at a time, excluding Aberration. On Aberration the Elemental Vault is a great place to find high level Megalosaurs, just keep in mind that it will be stuck within the caves as there is no land route that connects to the outside. However, you can produce eggs and hatch them outside. During the day, it is a peaceful sleeper, but by night, it is a carrying, mangling, ultimate destroyer, killing machine.'}, {Strategy: 'If you want to tame a Megalosaurus its best to tame them during the day when they are sluggish and a much lesser threat. However, you will need to make sure to KO it again when it is night. No matter what the torpor, the Megalosaurus will wake up once it hits night time.'}]

As with other starve-taming, be sure to wait until the torpor level drops and feed narcotics or narcoberries in bulk to keep the Torpor level rising till the max before starting to fall again. Their consumption speed also assures that no meat will be wasted, as long as the newest meats keep being added to the last slots. It can also be grabbed using a Tusoteuthis, and the torpor from the grab will eventually knock it out. This will, however, take a very long time.

However, if the battle seems fruitless for the Pachyrhinosaurus, it will flee and release a different, calming chemical to try and pacify its attackers, allowing the dinosaur to escape and recover. This chemical will not work on humans and some huge predators such as Tyrannosaurus Rex and Giganotosaurus.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Bug Repellant'}, {Taming: 'The Pachyrhinosaurus has a hardened head which decreases the amount of damage and torpor it receives. Players should shoot the body to knock the Pachyrhinosaurus out faster. The Pachyrhinosaurus also has an extremely fast torpor drop, which can make it quite difficult to knock out at lower levels. The Pachyrhinosaurus\' extremely fast torpor drop also make the Crossbow and Tranquilizer Arrows superior to the Longneck Rifle and Tranquilizer Darts for knock out due to the faster reload and shorter firing interval, as well as having nearly no chance of killing the Pachyrhinosaurus. If a Griffin is available, it is one of the easiest ways to knock out the Pachyrhinosaurus without using any kind of trap. After regenerating all stamina, fly off the ground to a height out of range of the Pachyrhinosaurus\' melee and gas-clouds. Engage the Pachyrhinosaurus with a Tranquilizer Arrow from high above it and as it approaches, it will stop and wait directly underneath the Griffin but not be able to attack it. Angle the Griffin straight down toward the ground, and shoot Tranquilizer Arrows through the Griffin\'s head (this does no damage or torpor to the Griffin). If lined up (watch for hit-markers to verify), the arrows will land directly in the body of the waiting Pachyrhinosaurus. The position above the Pachyrhinosaurus makes the body a much more reliable target! Count your shots, and soon the Pachyrhinosaurus will begin fleeing due to high torpor. Land the Griffin and chase/shoot the Pachyrhinosaurus from the back of the Griffin as it runs away to finish the knock out.'}, {General: 'The Pachyrhinosaurus\'s head acts as a shield, much like the Pachy. It has a damage multiplier of 0.15 for head and jaw. It takes more narcotics than most herbivores to keep down. It also has a unique diet, preferring bug repellent to vegetables or berries.'}, {Strategy: 'Don´t use small dinosaurs, because they mostly won´t even hit the Pachyrhinosaurus, because of the knockback. Pachyrhinosaurus does not have a lot of health and you can easily kill it from behind.'}]

They tend to spawn in groups of 2 or more.'}, {Strategy: 'Despite the Paracer\'s strength, it is slower than a player and its large size means it can be stuck behind boulders, but it will destroy any trees blocking its path. It can also be kited to a cliff where you can shoot it safely. When using a reasonably fast mount attacking its back feet is a good way to kill it fast and take minimal damage in the process. A decent ranged weapon such as a crossbow or a Longneck Rifle is effective at killing the Paracer before it can reach you. A decent dino can kill a single Paracer without problems, but a group can deal a large amount of damage quickly to the dino.'}]

A good idea for players without the bola engram is to position yourself away from where you wish to scare the Parasaur into such as a dead end or trees, this can turn a potentially lengthy chase into a quick kill. Quickly volley arrows into it or spears so it cannot get a chance to run in the first place. Dilo are good when trying to kill this dino at very little cost.

Generally, the Plesiosaur\'s level seems to create an extreme difference in the resources required to tame. Due to their very fast torpor decrease, you need a large amount of narcotics to maintain a Plesiosaur unconscious.

Another technique is to use the crossbow and attack the Plesiosaur from above. They seem to lose interest in you when you\'re near the surface, this allows you to take shots at them while still moving far enough away to make them lose interest. Repeat this process and you should be able to knock it out without much issue. This still leaves the risk of Megalodons and other Plesiosaurs attacking you and your tame, though, so be cautious. It is also recommended to have a raft with some storage boxes and beds floating above the spot where you are planning to tame a Plesio in case you need to respawn after dying, or you want to store your narcotics and other valuables you don\'t want to lose.

Repeat as necessary. If you don\'t already have access to a tamed Quetzal, the following strategy may be of use. Be sure not to knock out the Quetzal above water or it could drown to death. Using a Longneck Rifle, Shocking Tranquilizer Darts and a fast flying mount. Wait until a Quetzal flies close to a mountain or to the ground, land and then quickly shoot it with the darts. When it takes off in panic jump back on your mount and follow it, and repeat this process until its gets knocked unconscious. While this is a fairly reliable strategy, it can be very time consuming, expensive (Tranquilizer Darts require Simple Rifle Ammo to make, which are the second most expensive ammo in the game to make themselves) and you will have little control over where it lands, possibly putting it in the way of predators. Be careful that nothing on the mountain attacks the Quetzal while it\'s unconscious.'}, {General: 'Generally, the Quetzal is so rare and valuable that tribes never even consider killing one. In actuality, there are often battles for their tame, as a Quetzal is an extremely versatile mount that can turn an up-and-coming tribe into a powerhouse.

They never drop to the ground, so any approaches will be airborne assaults.'}, {Strategy: 'Using powerful Tranq Darts from a Longneck Rifle is the best way to knock them out of the sky for taming, no matter what method you use. In a PVP battle, use powerful weaponry like turrets to bring an enemy Quetzal down. A concentrated hail of minigun bullets can shred a low-level Quetzal in seconds, aiming at its Crest is counted as a headshot. Make sure that you do not fall when attempting to tame or kill the Quetzal. Otherwise, it will not attack.'}]

At first you may want to avoid them. One trick is to run to a herd of trikes, Stegos etc. and get the Raptors to hit and aggro them by accident, making a diversion or a means to gather lots of meat and hide. If a Raptor is a low level, a Spear can easily kill it, but beware, if they are in a pack of two or more, this strategy will not work! A way to kill high level ones, or two or more Raptors is to have a good climber, like a Thylacoleo, or a flyer.

Refrain from getting hit too often unless you are utilizing multiple riot shields, for its attacks easily shred armour durability. Take advantage of the Reaper\'s large body by wedging between two structures/rocks and a small opening. This will prevent them from reaching too close towards you. Be mindful of its tail attack as it inflicts large amounts of torpor damage. If going for the kill on a Queen, do not attempt to engage alone. They possess a vast amount of health and their spray attack is a potent narcotic. A large pack of high-level Ravagers or a high-level Rock Drake is (personally) advisable due to their attack strength and mobility, being able to evade the Queen. Carrying stimulants is also advised. Be wary when moving around as there is a relatively good chance that other Queens spawn nearby, making an already difficult battle even worse. A High level Megalosaurus can easily dispatch Queens before they need to heal at a plant z. 8k-10k hp and 500 melee is enough for low and mid level Queens. Tilt the odds even further in your favor by getting it mate boosted, imprinted, and equipping a better saddle. Be wary of buried Purlovia\'s. If they stun and knock you off your mount while fighting a Queen you are as good as dead. If in possesion of a Reaper King, the same method can be used as that of Megalosaurus. However, it cannot be mate-boosted, and is weak to charge light, which is essential to deal most damage to Reaper Queen. Well advised to get a decent Stat Reaper King when using this strategy. The easiest way to get impregnated is to dismount and remount in her presence and wait for her to grab you off your mount. You may need to dismount/remount again if she refuses to latch on(Maybe after 10 seconds). Impregnation can only occur when a Queen is surrounded by a pink aura, which only happens when she is nearly dead. Be mindful to time your dismount until after she attacks.'}]

This requires players to constantly check on the Torpor level, unlike many other long-wait dinosaurs, as the torpor level will drop to below 50% for a level 20 Spino in around five minutes. Take care when knocking them out as well, Spinosaurs are excellent climbers and can scale cliffs or rock piles you might not consider them capable of. However, as for very steep cliffs, they cannot. And since there are usually steep cliffs around Spinosaur habitats, a good way to tranquilize it is by shooting it from the top of a cliff until it starts running away. When it does, just recklessly charge at it until it gets stuck. Once it is stuck, finish it off. Also, spinosaurs usually prioritize attacking coels over humans, even if the human is attacking it. Just try not to tranquilize it while it is being attacked by sabertooth salmon or piranhas. When it is knocked out, it also loses torpor considerably fast, so be prepared with a lot of narcotics. Given how fast its torpor drops and that torpor in all creatures cannot decrease while it is increasing, 5 narcoberries are actually more effective against a spino than one narcotic, since they give less torpor but over more time. If you are going to use this tactic, be prepared to have a Trike or a different dino that can farm berries quickly, since it will require hundreds of narcotics. Force-feeding a stack of 100 narcoberries will increase its torpor by 750 over 5 minutes, meaning it will not drop in that time. Feeding multiple stacks will stack the effect.'}, {General: 'Spinosaurs live near water-areas and will also stay there. You can use this to make a quick escape by running from their water-source, sufficient speed and some luck (such as the Spino getting caught on trees and rocks) will save you easily. Other than that engage from range and you should be safe.'}, {Strategy: 'Avoid a direct confrontation unless you have a strong battle-mount. It\'s better to attack it from a ledge or flying mount. Melee attacks are generally futile as the Spino has large reach, knockback, speed, and damage to quickly deal with any interlopers caught near its mouth. Ranged attacks are all but necessary to bring it down. If you want to kill one for food or hide using melee weapons, construct a spike wall and attack it while it\'s on top of it while moving in and out to strike. This will deal major damage. A shield is recommended. If it runs away, chase it or use a ranged weapon before it can get food.'}]

It may be impossible to knock out a high-level tapejara within the time of a single bola. If it breaks out of the first bola and a second bola isn\'t in place, it\'ll flee and be very hard to catch. Another approach is to have pillars, ceilings, and walls in your shortcut hotbar; once the tapejara is hit with a bola, instead of tranquilizing it, use the bola time to quickly build a "trap" around it by placing a pillar on one side, ceilings above it, another pillar down from the other ceiling, then walls hanging from the ceilings all around. This may take some practice to position the trap parts correctly so the tapejara doesn\'t glitch out of it, but if it works, you can tranquilize the tapejara at your leisure, and already have some minimal protection around it once it\'s unconscious to protect it during taming. Demolish the trap when you\'re done. Be careful not to scare it in the air because once they get to a certain height they take a considerable amount of time to land again.

If you are not high level or have strong tames and you meet one on flat ground, run, on flat ground they are very fast and will decimate you swiftly. As with other medium-sized creatures, using a Quetzal or Wyvern to carry it, or using a fast mount to kite it, into a pen made out of materials it can\'t damage and then firing tranquilizers at it from windows or a high platform is also viable. If a Griffin is not available, this is the second-best option. Note that their torpor depletion rate is very high, about half that of a Quetzal. As such, it is important to keep them under the effects of the increase over time effect of ranged torpor weapons as you will quickly lose progress if you are unable to keep up the fire. This also gives arrows an advantage over darts as a single player will have to fire the rifle as fast as possible to prevent the torpor from depleting.'}, {General: 'The Thylacoleo spawns on the sides of trees ready to pounce on any unlucky creature should it come into this predator\'s pouncing range.

The pounce treats the rider and mount separately, and effects against one will not directly affect the other: Similar to the Kaprosuchus, it is possible for the Thylacoleo to dismount the rider and pin them to the ground. Similar to the Megalosaurus, it is also possible for the Thylacoleo to pin the mount itself - taking the survivor for a ride, but not preventing them from dismounting. Pinned creatures are stunned and cannot retaliate, but pinned players are not. Creatures too large to be pinned will not be affected by the attack and, if the attack hits the creature, no ill effects are passed to the player (unlike the purlovia, which dismounts the player in all cases but only stuns the player if the player specifically is hit).

The other eggs belonging to the same group are listed below the tables. All eggs in a group have the same taming-effects.

If you\'re forced to be within striking distance, it\'s best to carry some stimulant or Stimberries with you as a combatant against its venom. It should be said that many creatures in the cave can carry Stimberries on them, while this is not ideal it can prove life-saving. Furthermore, shields can prevent further Torpor increase whilst utilising Stimberries. Titanoboas are slow and awkward, so you\'re better off keeping your distance and peppering them from afar. Their large bodies ensure that shotguns are devastating in the caves or in the swamp and most mounts can ignore the torpor and trounce the Titanoboa soundly. If not too encumbered, simply walking backwards and shoving a spear or pike in their face can usually do the trick. As with most creatures, the hit box is larger than the collision box, so even if it does not make the "smacking sound", the attack still can hit. This tactic also works great for sarcos.'}]

    info: [{Behaviour: 'Since the Vulture lives most commonly in the hottest areas of the desert, any food it eats rots quickly. Thus you can mostly see them grouped around a carcass, even if the meat is spoiled. They will get defensive of anything they\'re eating, so they will attack any animals and players that wander too close.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Spoiled Meat'}, {Taming: 'The Vulture is unable to be tamed through the standard tranquilize-and-feed methods, and must be tamed non-violently, but this can be difficult as they become aggressive at the presence of a corpse. To feed it, place Raw or Spoiled Meat on the last slot of your hotbar, then approach and press use (default E) to feed it. You cannot feed them all the meat required for taming at one time, you must wait every couple of minutes until it is hungry again to feed it more until its taming meter is filled. The vulture will fly off every once in a while, and can easily be lost if one is not paying attention.'}, {General: 'They will attack you when there is a corpse in the vicinity.'}, {Strategy: 'As they will attack the rider and not the Dino, it is best to fight them with a pike as most tames have a hard time hitting them. Ranged weapons like bows can be used while they are chasing after you, but when they come close, shooting them is less effective. Spears or a pike can be helpful as well.'}]

This way ensures that no tribe member takes any damage from it.'}, {General: 'The Woolly Rhino is a rather threatening opponent, but with the right plan, can be dealt with accordingly. Without the right equipment or strategy you are an easy target for the higher leveled rhino.'}, {Strategy: 'There are many good strategies that exist to take down a Woolly Rhino. It has incredible melee power, so dealing with one usually incorporates ranged attacks. Bullets and arrows can take down one fairly quickly, but beware the deadly charging maneuver it will use to counter any ranged attacks. Attacking from higher ground such as a cliff or the back of a Quetzal will keep you safe from attack, if such a situation is available. It\'s also possible to use a decoy and then attack it. As there are many viable strategies, any will work as long as the Rhino cannot skewer a potential tribemate or beloved animal. Pike, a Spear or two, Longneck Rifle or explosive traps can kill Woolly Rhinos.'}]

    info: [{Behaviour: 'Extremely aggressive, often found flying around mountainous areas, or the dragon trenches looking for a fight. Can be found in four variations: Poison, Fire, Lightning, and Ice (only on Ragnarok).'},{'Preferred Food': 'Wyvern Milk'}, {Taming: 'Adult Wyverns can not be tamed. In order to get a tamed Wyvern, the player must steal and hatch a Wyvern Egg. Unlike most eggs, Wyvern eggs require a lot of heat to incubate properly; placing down any heat-emitting object such as Standing Torches or Campfires will work.'}, {General: 'Wyvern for all intents and purposes is the quintessential flying dragon; a very large dragon. Wyvern have massive wings with the same design mechanisms as bats but the grace and strength of the Condor. However, they also have a very long tail with a nob or fin depending on the Wyvern type; on all the tail acts as ballast and makes them highly maneuverable. The Wyvern in the wild is highly territorial and fierce in defending its perceived air space and its nest. It also has a notably more powerful bite; quite possibly the most dangerous challenge you can face short of a boss-level creature. Fighting one is definitely not for the faint of heart and flying a Wyvern is a thrill beyond comparison.'}, {Strategy: 'Wyverns are extremely difficult to fight due to their mobility and devastating attacks. Nape of Neck Strategy: You will need a flying mount with decent health and pumped stamina, and melee damage. Focus on the nape of the Wyvern\'s neck and attack there. When it tries to turn, you turn as well, so it cannot turn around enough to attack you. This is rather difficult due to Wyverns\' very small turning radius, but when executed correctly, it\'s very effective. A variation of this strategy is to attack its feet from below. Chain Bola: Get a Paracer with a Platform Saddle and build a Ballista on top, bait a Wyvern with any flying mount to the Paracer and chain it down with the chain bola. Then you can attack it with any Dino so it is easy to kill. Grappling Hook: Using a grappling hook to latch onto a Wyvern can make a difficult fight much simpler. Once attached, one can either melee the Wyvern with a sword or club/boomerang depending on whether you\'re aim is to kill or knock out or shoot at it with any firearm. A word of warning, though, depending on where you attach, the Wyvern may still be able to attack you with its melee. Also note that other Wyverns can attack you with relatively ease, so never adopt this tactic when fighting groups. Wyverns can also be baited over turrets set to attack wild dinos. This is quite effective as Wyverns are susceptible to same ranged damage modifiers as all other flying dinos.'}]

    info: [{Behaviour: 'The Yutyrannus is highly aggressive, killing anything it comes across, excluding Carnos. Approach with caution, as the Yutyrannus has a roar ability that can make tamed mounts become unsettled and bolt, regardless of commands, often taking the mounted rider with it.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Raw Mutton'}, {Taming: 'Cliffs: Use a fast mount that can outrun the Yutyrannus to a steep cliff, get on top, and start shooting with your preferred Tranq. Fliers: Use an Argentavis or a Quetzal to be high above the Yutyrannus and shoot it with your preferred tranq. Land to regain stamina sooner than you normally would - if its fear roar hits you while you are low on stamina your bird will sprint until it\'s exhausted, potentially forcing you to land in an unsafe location. Tanky Dinos: Use dinos with lot of health to absorb damage. Cage: Build a cage out of stone foundations (e.g. 2x3) with stone doorframes as walls. Place ramps at one side so you can lure the Yutyrannus into the cage by using a flyer or simply by running. Then you can easily shoot it with Tranqs without putting yourself in danger. You should kill the Carnos surrounding the Yutyrannus first.'}, {General: 'Never engage the Yutyrannus head on. Its roar will cause all dinos, except for Gigas, Rexs, Spinos, Wyverns, Woolly Rhinos, Mammoth, Rock Elementals, Alpha Predators, Bosses, Water Creatures and Brontos, tamed or untamed to run away from it, even if being ridden. Player movement speed needs to be at least 181% to outrun it.'}, {Strategy: 'Cliffs- Use a fast mount that can outrun the Yutyrannus. Get the Yutyrannus at the bottom of a steep cliff, get on top of the outcropping, and start shooting with your preferred tranq. Fliers- Use an Argentavis or a Quetzal to be high above the Yutyrannus and shoot it with your preferred tranq. Icebergs- Lure the Yutyrannus into water. Using a flyer works best, just quickly attack it and go land on a nearby iceberg to where he is forced to swim and can\'t climb up. The Yutyrannus will however ignore the iceberg\'s physics and still attack you. On Foot- Lure towards a wall (2 high) and tranq from other side. Yutyrannus has not been known to roar or crawl over. Kaprosuchus will also work.'}]
