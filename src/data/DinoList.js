Be careful not to kill the others while taming it, though, because lone Allosaurs will run away in search of a new pack if the old one is killed off. To combat this, the target Allosaur should be lured into an enclosure and properly secured before taking on the rest of its pack. It is best to attack them one at a time using ranged weapons.'}, {General: 'Do not attempt to take out the pack leader first: take out the others and the leader will lose its Alpha boost.

It is best to attack them one at a time using ranged weapons. Another approach is to overwhelm them with superior numbers by leading a pack of your own into the fight- just be careful to not be singled out or get in the way of the Alpha'}]

    info: [{Behaviour: 'Despite being described in its Dossier as being generally skittish, the Angler will attack the player and any tamed creatures on sight. When damaged in a fight, they will attempt to flee but will turn around and attack again after a short chase.'},{'Preferred Food': 'Raw Mutton'}, {Taming: 'Since the Angler lives deep underwater, the only way to knock it out is with a Crossbow and Tranquilizer Arrows, a Harpoon Launcher with Tranq Spear Bolts (or a Wooden Club, if you\'re feeling adventurous). Be careful to not deal too much damage at once, as it has relatively low health compared to its torpor, so it\'s easy to kill it accidentally. The Angler can also deal a decent amount of damage itself, so be sure to suit up in a full set of SCUBA gear. Once they take a bit of damage, they will attempt to swim away. Be careful if you chase them, as they will often turn around and attack again without warning. A good strategy is to bring a tough underwater mount, such as a Plesiosaur, and set it to passive. That way, once it has been shot, the Angler will target your mount instead of you, giving time to take it down in relative safety.'}, {General: 'One must first take into consideration the environment that the Angler lives in, the deep ocean. Other animals patrol these waters, making Angler combat or taming difficult. Ichthyosaurs, though friendly, tend to swarm the player and can easily become overwhelming if one attracts the attention of too many of them. Additionally, predators like Megalodon, Mosasaurs, and Plesiosaurs can attack at any time: even the Anglers themselves are dangerous. Finally, asphyxiation and temperature hazards will finish off any survivors rather quickly that have not equipped themselves with a full set of SCUBA Gear.'}, {Strategy: 'Often, the angler will be the one attacking you. In that case, use your mount if it has enough health and attack damage, but also make sure your mount has a quick turning circle to compete with the angler\'s agility. Fighting the Angler without a mount is also possible; use ranged melee weapons that can keep Anglers at bay, like Pikes (Spears are not recommended due to break chance) and when it runs away, use a Crossbow or a Harpoon Launcher to finish it off.'}]
